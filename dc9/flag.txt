Congratulations - you have done well to get to this point.

Hope you enjoyed DC-9.  Just wanted to send out a big thanks to all those
who have taken the time to complete the various DC challenges.

I also want to send out a big thank you to the various members of @m0tl3ycr3w .

They are an inspirational bunch of fellows.

Sure, they might smell a bit, but...just kidding.  :-)

Sadly, all things must come to an end, and this will be the last ever
challenge in the DC series.

So long, and thanks for all the fish.
